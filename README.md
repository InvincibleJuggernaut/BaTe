<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Over time, batteries lose their designed charging capacity and their ability to store the charge decreases. It is a little bit cumbersome to know the current laptop battery charging capacity. BaTe helps in achieving this by checking the battery charging capacity and logs it into a spreadsheet file. This task could be automated completely by using Windows' Task Scheduler.</p>
