<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Over time, batteries lose their designed charging capacity and their ability to store the charge decreases. It is a little bit cumbersome to know the current laptop battery charging capacity. BaTe helps in achieving this by checking the battery charging capacity and logs it into a spreadsheet file. This task could be automated completely by using Windows' Task Scheduler.</p>


<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

<p> BaTe makes use of the following Python libraries : 
<ul>
  <li>xlrd</li>
  <li>xlutils</li>
  <li>xlwt</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
